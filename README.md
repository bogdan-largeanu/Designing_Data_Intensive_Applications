1. Part 1: The fundamental ideas that underpin the design of data-intesive applications.
    - Chapter 1. What is Reliability,Scalability and maintanability ?
        - Reliability:
            - Simple Definition: Continue to work correctly, even when things go wrong.  
            - Things that can go wrong are faults. System anticipating faults are fault-tolerant or resilient.
            - Fault is not the same as a failure. Fault is deviating from the spec of the system.
            - Errors come from. Hardware Errors, Software Errors, Human Errors. One study found configuration errors by operators to be the leading cause of outages, where hardware faults (servers or network)

2. Part 2: Move from data store on one machone tp data that is distributed across machines. Often needed for scalability
3. Part 3: Discuss Systems that derive some datasets from other datasets. Derived data often occurs in heterogenerous systems(multiple system CPU, GPU) where one database can't do everything well. Potential example is a media website that use mySql for user account data and AWS S3 buckets for storing the media.
